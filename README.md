# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration


## Introduction

This project involves cloning the PhonePe Pulse dataset from the PhonePe GitHub repository and transforming the data into a dataframe using Pandas. The transformed data is then stored in a MySQL database with the help of MySQL Connector and SQLAlchemy engine. An interactive dashboard is developed using Streamlit and Plotly, featuring geoplots and other visualization elements for enhanced data exploration and insights.

## Overview
Data Extraction:
The data is extracted from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and cloned to the local environment, ensuring access to the latest dataset for analysis.

Data Transformation:
The raw data undergoes transformation, including cleaning, formatting, and structuring in dataframe format using Pandas.

Database Integration:
MySQL Connector is used for the connection between Python and MySQL database with XAMPP, enabling data transfer. SQLAlchemy's engine facilitates efficient data insertion and querying, simplifying database interactions for Python.

Data Visualization and Analysis:
With the assistance of Streamlit and Plotly, a dashboard and charts are created, offering geospatial visualizations and top insights. This setup empowers users to explore and reveal trends within the dataset, facilitating insightful analysis.
